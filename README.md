Scripts to do some Quora analytics

This repo is under active development. I have directly copied the python crawler script from [Brian Bi's Quora Back Up](https://github.com/t3nsor/quora-backup).

#### Q-Index
This script computes the Q-Index of a user from his / her downloaded answers. Let's define a user's q-index, inspired by the h-index, as the highest number q for which it is true that the user has q answers with at least q upvotes. See [Q-Index Topic on Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/Q-index-1) for more details.
